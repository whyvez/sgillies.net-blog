=====

I'm `Sean Gillies <http://sgillies.net>`__, a programmer living in Fort
Collins, Colorado and working at `MapBox <http://mapbox.com>`__. In the past
I've developed ground-breaking Digital Classics projects, provided Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) consulting, pounded pixels as a satellite imagery
analyst, and studied Physics and Atmospheric Science. This is my blog and I am
solely responsible for its content.  The title is a reference to "Split Myself
in Two" from `Meat Puppets II
