Choucroute Garnie
=================

It's the season.

Cabbage is a cultivar of Brassica oleracea.

Starting from Bruce Aidell's recipe from the Pork book.

Thinly slice onions so they'll disappear into the choucroute as it cooks.
Saut√© with garlic, carrot in a tablespoon of bacon drippings or vegetable oil.

Drained and well-rinsed sauerkraut. I used Bubbies. It's going to cook for
a couple hours, so start with some that still has a bit of crunch, not mushy
canned sauerkraut.

A cup of chicken broth and a cup of wine.

Quick cured fresh side pork (fresh slab bacon) - also Aidell's recipe.

Hot dogs (aka frankfurters)
Smoked brats
Ham hock

IMO, something smoked is essential. Ham hock should go in early. Slab
bacon, too. Sausages at the end.

Bake with lid on.
