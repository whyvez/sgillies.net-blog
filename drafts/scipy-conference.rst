SciPy Conference
================

I'm back from my first ever trip to SciPy, the annual scientific Python community
conference. I found it quite amazingly good.

Slides from my talk on Wednesday are at
https://sgillies.github.io/scipy-2014-rasterio/. I feel like it went well and
hope that you found (and will find it) useful, too. I missed Tuesday's
sessions, which were jam packed with geospatial talks, and didn't have time to
check out all the slides from those before presenting. Referencing other talks
is something I usually try to do, and failing to do so felt a little weird. My
talk was sandwiched between Tyler Erickson's on Google Earth Engine and Shawn
Walbridge's on workflows and distribution of GIS Science toolkits; a nice
showing of research and science going on at Google, Mapbox, and Esri.

The IPython Notebook seemed to be the major touchstone for presenters and other
attendees of the conference, and rightly so. I've got all kinds of plans for
doing things with it, many that I expressed at the conference, and I'm certain
that it's going to spread in GIS circles. Features coming soon to notebooks
near you include: map interactivity, Native Client notebooks, Google Drive
hosted notebooks, and a new `language agnostic platform
<https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/project-jupyter>`__. I enjoyed getting to meet
Fernando Perez and Brian Granger and congratulate them on the success of the
project.

Greg Wilson's keynote, `available on Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA>`__, was a challenge to apply science to the teaching of programming and other
subjects. I definitely recommend watching it. A strange recommendation from me, I 
know, since I'm more likely to say things like "keynotes are terrible." Keynotes
that stroke the audience are terrible. Wilson's is better than that.

Best part of the trip for me was sprinting on GeoPandas and other projects with
Kelsey Jordahl, Nora Deram, Jacob Wasserman (remotely), Matt Perry, Taylor
Oshan, Carson Farmer, Shawn Walbridge, Serge Ray, and Philip Stephens. I learned
a ton about Pandas and GeoPandas, made some solid contributions to the project, and
all in great company. It was a pleasure and a privilege.

One sobering thing is being reminded that not everyone enjoys the same pleasure
and privilege. It's important to read and think about April Wright's thoughts
on SciPy: http://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/lonely.html.
