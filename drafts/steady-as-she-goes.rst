Steady as she goes
==================

Standards organizations are increasingly interested in the little format that
could and if http://www.w3.org/2014/05/geo-charter is any indication it's
likely that you'll be seeing more mention of `GeoJSON <http://geojson.org>`__
and `GeoJSON-LD <http://github.com/geojson/geojson-ld>`__ in OGC and W3C
materials soon. However, the GeoJSON working group (for which I'm speaking in
just this and the following sentence), is going to keep its own independent
course. Work on the `GeoJSON Internet Draft
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-butler-geojson-03>`__ will continue to be
done at https://github.com/geojson/draft-geojson and on the GeoJSON `discussion
list <http://lists.geojson.org/listinfo.cgi/geojson-geojson.org>`__.

Now, Mapbox has recently joined the OGC and I've subsequently received emails
from OGC members seeking discussion of GeoJSON. This is exactly the thing that
I want to avoid and I will decline to do so outside of the GeoJSON venues
I listed above. I hope you will, too, because discussions of GeoJSON on closed OGC
technical committee lists or private emails with other OGC members aren't going
to do the GeoJSON format, I-D, or users any good. GeoJSON is for the open web.
Let's continue to tend it on the open web.
