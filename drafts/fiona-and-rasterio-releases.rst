Fiona and Rasterio releases
===========================

Like everyone else, I'm making releases for FOSS4G. Fiona 1.2 has a bunch of
fun `new features <https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/blob/master/CHANGES.txt#L4>`__
and Rasterio 0.12 has `new CLI commands and options <https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio/blob/master/CHANGES.txt#L4>`__.

On 9 September, I plan to release Shapely 1.4, the first version with new features
since the project made the jump to Python 3. There will be quite a lot of `new stuff
in 1.4 <https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely/blob/master/CHANGES.txt#L4>`__. It's
been a group effort and largely motivated by development of visualization and 
analytic frameworks like `Cartopy <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/>`__ and 
`GeoPandas <http://geopandas.org/>`__.
