Fiona and Rasterio releases
===========================

Like everyone else, I'm making releases before FOSS4G. Fiona 1.2 has a bunch of
bug fixes and `new features
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/blob/master/CHANGES.txt#L4>`__ (contributed
largely by Ren√© Buffat) and Rasterio 0.12 has `new CLI commands and options
<https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio/blob/master/CHANGES.txt#L4>`__. I'll be
talking about these packages and their design and use first thing Wednesday
morning (September 10) at FOSS4G. I've also got some things to say about Python
programming and geographic data that are not specific to Fiona and Rasterio.

The big deal, however, will be the release of Shapely 1.4 on September 9. This
is the first version with major new features since the project made the jump to
Python 3. There will be quite a lot of `new stuff in 1.4
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely/blob/master/CHANGES.txt#L4>`__ including
better interaction with IPython Notebooks, vectorized functions, an R-tree, and
lots of speedups. It's been a group effort largely motivated by development of
visualization and analytic frameworks: `Cartopy
<http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/>`__ and `GeoPandas <http://geopandas.org/>`__.
Joshua Arnott and Jacob Wasserman have been putting a lot of time into making
Shapely better and faster over the past couple of weeks. If you're a Shapely user,
please do something nice for these two the next time you see them.
