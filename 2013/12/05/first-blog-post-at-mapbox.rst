First blog post at MapBox
=========================

I've made my first post for the MapBox blog: `Mapping the open web using
GeoJSON <http://mapbox.com/blog/open-web-geojson>`__. It's a roundup of
products and services at work that employ GeoJSON and a bit of an explanation
of why the format fits MapBox so well. I work at a company that puts developers
first, and GeoJSON is a format that also puts developers first.

What I didn't mention in the post is how much I see the format used for
getting things done everyday at work. Cutline for gdalwarp? GeoJSON. Need to
share some data in a Gist with another developer? GeoJSON. Quick map to help
someone get from A to B? GeoJSON. Of course this is what the GeoJSON authors
were hoping to make possible, but it's pretty exciting to see it happening,
and in unanticipated ways.

Blogging at MapBox is super slick thanks to the engineering work `Mike Morris
wrote about recently <https://www.mapbox.com/blog/unit-test-blog/>`__ and
I found the amount and quality of feedback fascinating â€“ seven different people
collaborated with me on the post in one way or another. I'm looking forward to
the next one.
