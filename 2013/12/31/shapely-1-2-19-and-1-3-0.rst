Shapely 1.2.19 and 1.3.0
========================

`Shapely 1.2.19 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely/1.2.19>`__ and `Shapely
1.3.0 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`__ have been tagged and uploaded
to PyPI.

1.2.19 adds buffer styling, work (see `buffer.hires.png <http://toblerity.org/shapely/code/buffer.hires.png>`__) that was done by `Johannes Sch√∂nberger
<https://github.com/ahojnnes>`__. 1.3.0 has no new features other than
support for Python 3.x, for which we traded in support for Python 2.5 and
lower. The force behind the Python 3 work is `Mike Toews
<https://github.com/mwtoews>`__. Johannes and Mike aren't the only
contributors to these releases. We're up to `19 contributors
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely/graphs/contributors>`__ since moving to
GitHub, not counting another 6-7 contributors from the olden days.

If you're still on Python 2.5 (or 2.4), the 1.3.0 release is inconvenient: pip
and easy_install are going to grab it by default and it won't work for you.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to specify Shapely 1.2.x releases explicitly like
``pip install Shapely==1.2.19``. If you're using a more modern Python, ``pip
install Shapely`` will fetch 1.3.x from now on.

The Shapely development plan for 2014: bug fixes and new GEOS version support
in 1.3.x (and 1.2.x when possible) and architectural changes for more speed and
other features for future Shapely versions in the master branch.
