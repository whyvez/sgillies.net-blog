Joining MapBox
==============

`As announced <https://www.mapbox.com/blog/sean-gillies-joins-mapbox/>`__ on
the company blog, I'm now working at MapBox. I'm excited about this. I'm more
than excited. My 8 year-old thinks she knows what excitement is, but dear
child, this is something else. Working on bigger things with all the talented
and thoughtful folks at MapBox is going to be fun.

Is the transition from academic to commerical work going to be hard? I've 
worked at fast-paced companies before – experience that definitely factored
into my being hired by the AWMC – and I'm happy to be back. And because I'll
be continuing to work on open source geospatial software, data, and protocols,
I feel like my favorite academic communities win from having me on the
`mersh <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mersh>`__ side of things.

What am I going to be working on? A bunch of different things, but my near
future involves pixels. Gazillions of pixels. MapBox uses Shapely and Fiona
already, so I'll get to stay involved with those projects. 

Will I be moving to Washington, D.C. or San Francisco? No, I'm mainly going
to work from Fort Collins, but I'll be at one of the offices regularly. I hope
to persuade people that the Fort wouldn't be a terrible place to visit for
sprints, either. Relatively cheap accomodations and food and plenty of nice
beers to meet.

Thanks, everyone, for the overwhelming well wishes.
