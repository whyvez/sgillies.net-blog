Downgrading My Blog
===================

Welcome to my new blog. It's made with `Tinkerer <http://tinkerer.me>`__.
I'm calling it a downgrade because there's no more database, no more comments,
no more Python objects published for every request. It's just rsync and static
HTML generated by Tinkerer and Sphinx from ReStructured Text docs I type into
Vim.  There are moving parts in this new blog, but they are all on my laptop.
None of them are deployed to a web server.

My old posts were all written using ReST, so migrating is going to be easy
peasy. Until I get around to it, old posts will be at
http://sgillies.net/olden-days-blog/ and I'll make sure the old URLs redirect.
