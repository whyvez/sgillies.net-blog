Back from FOSS4G
================

In my experience, FOSS4G was tons of fun and very well run. Chapeau to the
organizing team! I hope other attendees got as much out of the conference as
I did. Not only did I get to catch up with people I met at the dawn of FOSS4G,
I met great people I'd only known from Twitter and made entirely new
acquaintances. I even got to speak a bit of French.

My talk was one of the first in the general sessions. I had fun presenting and
am told that I did a good job. My slides are published at
http://sgillies.github.io/foss4g-2014-fiona-rasterio/#/ and you can fork them
from `GitHub <https://github.com/sgillies/foss4g-2014-fiona-rasterio>`__.
According to the information at the `FOSS4G Live Stream page
<https://2014.foss4g.org/live/>`__ all the talks will be available online soon.
I missed plenty that I'm looking forward to seeing on my computer. Out of the ones
I attended, I particularly recommend seeing the following:

- "Using OpenStreetMap Infrastructure to Collect Data for our National Parks"
  by James McAndrew, National Park Service
- "Managing public data on GitHub: Pay no attention to that git behind the
  curtain" by Landon Reed, Atlanta Regional Commission
- "Big (enough) data and strategies for distributed geoprocessing" by Robin
  Kraft, World Resources Institute
- "An Automated, Open Source Pipeline for Mass Production of 2 m/px DEMs from
  Commercial Stereo Imagery" by David Shean, University of Washington

Did the `code of conduct
<https://2014.foss4g.org/attending/code-of-conduct/>`__ work? I heard one
speaker invoke images of barely competent moms – "so easy your mother can do
it" – and was present for a unfortunate reference to hacking private photos at
lunch time. I hope that was all of it.

If you attended FOSS4G or watched the live feed I encourage you to write about your
experience and impressions. Come on, do it. It doesn't have to be long or
comprehensive. Here are a few blog posts I've seen already:
